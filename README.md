# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

A Python-based tool designed to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Features
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Automatically checks if a web application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **XSS Detection**: Scans for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Customizable**: Easily add more vulnerability checks based on your needs.
- **Reports**: Provides a summary report of vulnerabilities discovered during the scan.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
  - `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing and scraping HTML content.
  - `re` (regular expressions): To help identify vulnerabilities in HTML responses.
  
## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd web-vulnerability-scanner
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the scanner:

bash
Copy code
python vulnerability_scanner.py
How It Works
SQL Injection: The scanner injects commonly used SQL injection payloads into form fields or URL parameters to check for vulnerabilities.
XSS Detection: The scanner submits HTML/JavaScript payloads into form fields or URL parameters to identify XSS vulnerabilities.
Usage
Edit the vulnerability_scanner.py to add the target URL you want to scan:

python
Copy code
target_url = "http://example.com"
Start the scan by running the script:

bash
Copy code
python vulnerability_scanner.py
The scan results will be displayed in the terminal and can be saved to a log file if required.

Example Output
csharp
Copy code
[INFO] Scanning http://example.com for vulnerabilities...
[INFO] SQL Injection test: Passed
[WARNING] XSS Vulnerability detected in http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>

Roadmap
 Add support for more vulnerabilities like CSRF.
 Improve report generation (JSON, CSV, etc.).
 Add support for scanning multiple URLs in batch mode.
